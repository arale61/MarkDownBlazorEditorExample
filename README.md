# MarkDown Blazor Editor Example

## This is just an example
This example uses [**Markdig**](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) as the **Markdown parser**.

[**Markdig**](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) is licensed with [BSD-Clause 2 license](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/license.txt).

## Motivation
After being watching some **#viciostv** was curious about **Markdig** and also about **Blazor**.
I drafted this simple sample for it.

## How to test it

```
git clone https://github.com/arale61/MarkDownBlazorEditorExample.git
cd MarkDownBlazorEditorExample
dotnet watch
```

After launching the application, go to **/mdcontainer**.
